# :fontawesome-solid-clipboard-list: Requirements

To get started with LunaSea-ng developement on any platform, you will need to ensure the following tools are installed:

1. <a href="https://flutter.dev" target="_blank" title="Flutter">Flutter</a>  
2. <a href="https://nodejs.org/en" target="_blank" title="Node.js (v14+)">Node.js (v14+)</a>

## Flutter

To validate Flutter's installation, please ensure that `flutter doctor -v` does not return any issues with your current installation.

## Node.js

LunaSea-ng uses Node.js for installing Git Hooks for the repository and for helper scripts. While it is not necessary to install Node.js for development, it will ensure you follow the required commit message format and give access to scripts that can be helpful for development.

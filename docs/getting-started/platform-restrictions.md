## Web-Specific Restrictions

### **HTTPS Requirement**

LunaSea's web instances are hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and use [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) TLS certificates to ensure that an encrypted connection is utilized when loading the LunaSea web application package.

One limitation this incurs is that most modern web browsers no longer support [mixed content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Mixed\_content), so it is required when using these browsers to utilize a reverse proxy (or something similar) to expose a secure (`HTTPS`) connection to your instances even when hosted on the same machine.

!!! warning
	**All network communication occurs directly between your web browser and host machine**, but this is a limitation put forward by the web browsers.

### Wake on LAN Support

Wake on LAN support will **never** be supported when using LunaSea on the web, because the Wake on LAN protocol relies on the [User Datagram Protocol (UDP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User\_Datagram\_Protocol). UDP connections are not supported in the web browser because of underlying security constraints, and so it will not be possible to utilize wake on LAN now or at any point in the future when using LunaSea on the web.

However, torrent support currently is not possible in LunaSea because of the restrictions Apple has put forward.

This includes a P2P client that runs directly on the device and linking to a P2P client that is running on an external machine.</p> <p>Torrent support is not completely off the table and may come in the future!

They cannot and should not be used as the host, but is commonly used because users mainly access the service from the computer running it. In order for LunaSea to connect, you must find the local IP of your computer (most common home networking configurations have it start with <code>192.168.0.x</code> or <code>192.168.1.x</code>)</li> <li>Ensure you match the right API key to the right service. I know this seems like an obvious thing, but you'd be surprised how easy it is to mix up 3-4 API keys when you're going back and forth copying and pasting!</li> <li>For the -arr services, ensure the binding address in the advanced general settings is not set to <code>127.0.0.1</code> or <code>localhost</code>, but instead set to either <code>0.0.0.0</code>, <code>*</code>, or the local IP for the computer/server.</li> <li>Similarly for the clients, ensure that the host is set to <code>0.0.0.0</code>, or the local IP.</li> <li>As noted in the host prompt, you must add either <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code> before the IP or domain. LunaSea does not make any assumptions on the protocol to use (http or https).</li> <li>Do not use <code>3xx</code> redirecting webpages. This is not supported for POST and PUT requests (sending data back to the module) and can cause many headaches, so ideally you should be pointing directly to the module on your network.</li> <li>(Windows Only): For a lot of software to correctly bind to your network, you need to ensure that you run the software as administrator. This is specifically very important for the -arrs, which will only bind to your host machine if you do not run it as administrator.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"faq/#how-can-i-access-my-services-remotely","title":"How Can I Access My Services Remotely?","text":"<p>While this is outside of the scope of this project, I can try to point you in the right direction!</p> <ul> <li>Reverse Proxy: A reverse proxy allows you to open 1 or 2 ports on your network (typically 443 for SSL/https connections and 80 for http connections). Using a reverse proxy also allows you to attach a domain name to your IP and generate a free SSL certificate for https (hint, LetsEncrypt). Some common options for reverse proxies are NGINX Proxy Manager, Traefik, NGINX, and Apache.</li> <li>VPN Tunnelling: Another option is to create a VPN tunnel back to your home network, which would allow you to access your services as if you are on your home network. Tools like WireGuard and OpenVPN are perfect for this use case. This is technically the most secure method, but a bit less convenient than using a reverse proxy.</li> <li>Direct Port Forwarding: This method is not recommended, but another option is directly forward the ports of the services on your router and access the services via <code>&lt;External IP&gt;:&lt;Port&gt;</code>. The reason this is not recommended is because all of the traffic is sent unencrypted (you can use self-signed certificates, but this causes more headaches related to certificate authorities), and the more ports that are open on your network the less secure it is.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"faq/#i-want-to-complain-where-can-i-complain","title":"I Want to Complain!
